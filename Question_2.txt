i)

I implemented a Monte Carlo simulation on the correlation coefficient between time spent on social media and academic performance,
and as the histogram exhibits we can see that the correlation coefficient is strong and negative.

ii)

To understand the effect of time spent on social media on academic performance I would estimate a regression model with academic performance
as the dependent variable and time spent on social media as the independent variable.


iii)


This regression cannot be casually interpreted in this context since we are aware, by design, that there is a confounding variable -stress levels- driving
the correlation between time spent on social media and academic performance.

iv)

I would run a regression of academic performance on time spent on social media including stress levels as a control variable, and check by how much the coefficient
on social media changes. I expect it to decrease by controlling for stress levels. Indeed, as we can see on the output by adding the stress level variable 
to the regression the statistical significance of time spent on social media vanished.
