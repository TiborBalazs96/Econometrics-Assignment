i) 

The correlation between ice cream sales and swimming pool attendance is 0.9908, which is an extremely high correlation.

ii)

The correlation between ice cream sales and swimming pool attendance definitely not imply a causal relationship between the two variables,
in my intuition, there has to be a confounding variable, namely temperature, which is the true cause of both ice cream sales and swimming pool attendance.
We can see that the correlations between temperature and ice cream sales and swimming pool attendance are, respectively 0.9969 and 0.9936, which is extremely strong as well.

iii)

We can include temperature as a control variable in the regressions, as we do not have to worry about reverse causality in this case, since neither 
ice cream sales nor swimming pool attendance can causally influence the whether. In contrast, temperature can intuitively cause higher ice cream sales and 
higher swimming pool attendance. If we control for temperature in the following regressions:

reg ice_cream_sales swimming_pool_attendance
reg swimming_pool_attendance ice_cream_sales


reg ice_cream_sales swimming_pool_attendance temperature
reg swimming_pool_attendance ice_cream_sales temperature

we can see that the bad control variables (swimming pool attendance in the first case, and ice cream sales in the second case) lose their statistical 
significance in the regressions. The two variables are bad controls, because they might as well be dependent variables in this context, since the temperature
variable is the true underlying cause driving the correlations.
